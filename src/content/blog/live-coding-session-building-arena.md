**tl;dr: I built and shipped a brand-new feature live (in ~1 hour), watch how I approach agentic engineering with codex**

Join me for an unfiltered look at building Arena - a live coding session where you can see my development process in action, unscripted. Thanks to Eleanor Berger for motivating me to do this video and for organizing the live event!

## What we built

🤖 Heads up! This is an AI-Assisted summary.

* **Feature:** *Arena* — a new feature in my upcoming project, to see how well 2–4 users from X match
* **Input:** Twitter/X user handles
* **Pipeline:** fetch N tweets per user (shares a 1,000-tweet budget), strip to necessary fields, run profile analysis, then **score compatibility** (per pair + whole team)
* **UX:** user picker + "Analyze" button, results table, cached runs selectable under the search box
* **Infra touches:** DB migration for `arena_cache`, long-running job in the background, streaming UI, auth-guarded page

I managed to complete the feature in ~1h, and we got a  **pair score of 89** for me and [@intellectronica](https://x.com/intellectronica).

## Stack & Setup

* **Model workflow:** codex (OpenAI/GPT-5) for coding sessions; it eagerly **reads the codebase** and generally "does the right thing" without handheld file lists. I keep a separate Claude-style flow for some web searching, but for repo work codex is the star.
* **Sessions:** start *fresh* for big features, run **multiple agent windows** in parallel; switch tasks while one is thinking.
* **Branching:** work **directly on `main`** with **atomic commits**. Merge conflicts + worktrees cost speed; small, well-scoped commits keep things safe.
* **Tooling:**

  * **Ghostty** for terminals, split panes with agents
  * **Better Stack** logging via a tiny [**`bslog`**](https://github.com/steipete/bslog) CLI
  * An **`xl`** CLI (`curl` wrapper) for quick X API pulls
  * Strict **biome** rules + custom codemods to normalize output
  * **Background worker** for long jobs ([Inngest](https://www.inngest.com/))
  * **Cache table** to avoid recompute
* **Docs ingestion:** pull only what's needed, prefer **markdown** via a crawler over raw HTML to save tokens.
* **Validation:** schema validation on inputs; fail fast and surface helpful messages.

## Tactics that mattered

* **Keep the agent context clean.** Minimize tool noise and only inject docs when needed; markdown > HTML to conserve context.
* **Let codex plan on demand.** It proposes next steps that are usually solid; green-light them in sequence.
* **Cache long tasks early.** Add a table + background job queue before you polish UI; this saves you from re-running expensive analysis.
* **Copy-paste errors verbatim.** Don't over-explain; just drop logs in and let the agent fix what broke.
* **Comments as spec.** Ask for clear intent comments near tricky code; they're for you and for the agent on the next session.
* **Write tests afterwards, not first.** These agents are great at back-filling tests once the shape exists, and that's usually enough to catch regressions.
* **Work on `main`, commit surgically.** You still get speed with safety. Backups + Git are your safety net.
* **Avoid local models for this workload.** Context and stability matter more than shaving milliseconds.
* **CLIs beat MCPs.** A 2-hour CLI wrapper (logs, API pulls) pays for itself and keeps context small.
* **Small "proof" projects unblock big features.** If streaming or a protocol is hard, build a tiny in-repo example that works, then transplant.

## Q&A highlights

* **Why Codex over Claude Code?** Codex actually **reads more of the repo** without handholding; requires fewer "look here, then there" hints. Claude still useful for search/web, but for coding Codex felt faster end-to-end.
* **Do you branch?** Not for features at this stage. **Main + disciplined commits** is faster and - counterintuitively - safer for rapid iteration.
* **Manual approvals for agent actions?** No. That becomes "Windows Vista prompts." Use Git + backups; review diffs; move fast.
* **Repo prompts & MCP servers?** Nice idea, but they bloat context and introduce fragility. **Lean instructions + small CLIs** work better.
* **Compaction & long sessions?** Plan features to **fit the context**. If you expect many loops (e.g., test repairs), use the flow that compacts well - or split the task.
